"""User Interface (UI) Panels for 4D BIM Scheduling - Modular Organization.

This package contains the Panel (bpy.types.Panel) and UIList (bpy.types.UIList) 
classes, thematically organized to build the addon's interface in Blender.

The structure is as follows:
- panels_schedule.py: Panels for managing schedules, tasks, variance analysis, and ICOM.
- panels_animation.py: Panels dedicated to 4D animation configuration, color schemes, camera control, orbit, and HUD settings.
- panels_workplan.py: Panels for managing Work Plans and Calendars.
- elements.py: Contains reusable UI elements, primarily the UIList classes that display data lists.

The __init__.py file acts as an orchestrator, importing all components and managing 
their centralized registration and unregistration in Blender.
